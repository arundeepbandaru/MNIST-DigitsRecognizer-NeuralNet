# MNIST Digit Recognizer

This repository contains code for a neural network model that recognizes hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and is trained to classify digits from 0 to 9. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation, along with plotting training curves and a confusion matrix for performance assessment.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `Pillow`, and `scikit-image`).
2. Run the script `mnist_digit_recognizer.py` to train the model and evaluate its performance.
3. The script will display training curves and a confusion matrix to assess the model's accuracy.
4. Be amazed by the magic of neural networks in recognizing hand-written digits!
